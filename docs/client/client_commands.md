`await` cannot be used during timeruns, and queued commands are cleared when a timerun starts.
```

`fireteam countdown [seconds (1-10)]`  

Executes fireteam actions. `rules` and `teamjump` can only be set by the fireteam admin.

Enabling teamjump mode is required for [`target_ftrelay`](../mapping/mapping_entities.md/#target_ftrelay) to activate targets for each fireteam member.

`countdown` will perform an automated countdown in fireteam chat from the given `seconds` value. This can be used to coordinate timings on teamjumps. If `seconds` is not given, the default value will be taken from [`etj_fireteamCountdownLength`](./etjump_cvars.md/#etj-fireteamcountdownlength) cvar.

Available rules:
* `noghost <on|1> <off|0>` - toggles player collision between fireteam members

* **1** reset velocity to 0

Timerun state can only be saved from demos recorded in ETJump 3.3.0 or newer. For demos recorded prior to that, the position will save normally, but loading it won't restore the timerun state.
